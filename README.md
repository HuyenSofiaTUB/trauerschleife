# Ribbon Designer
The Ribbon Designer Web App is an online tool that allows users to easily design ribbons for print. The app provides users with a simple and intuitive interface that enables them to add text and motifs to their ribbon designs, change the font type and size, and preview the design as it would appear once printed.
